# Python Calculator

This Python script serves as a simple calculator, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations. The script includes a calculator function for interactive use and separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and floor division.

## Usage

1. **Run the Calculator:**
   - Execute the script using a Python interpreter:
     ```bash
     python calculator.py
     ```
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to select an operation and input numbers.

2. **Perform Arithmetic Operations:**
   - The script provides options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and floor division.
   - Enter the required information, and the script will display the result.

## Functions

### Calculator Function

The main calculator function (`calculator()`) takes user input for the operation choice and two numbers, then performs the selected operation and displays the result.

### Arithmetic Functions

Additional functions (`add()`, `subtraction()`, `multiply()`, `division()`, `modulus()`, and `floor_division()`) perform specific arithmetic operations. These functions are called separately for individual calculations.

## Note

- This script is a basic calculator for educational purposes.
- Feel free to customize or expand the script based on your requirements.
- Ensure valid input is provided to avoid errors during execution.
